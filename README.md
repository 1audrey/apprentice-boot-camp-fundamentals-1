<!--- ORGANISER THINGS TO CONSIDER 
- Which technical competencies, behaviours and knowledge module topics does the bootcamp cover/meet
- Structuring retros so that they can inform thinking for individual's personal learning records (off the job training record tab in their learning logs)
- Introducing some sort of test or quiz on basic concept learning points from the bootcamp to validate that they have taken stuff in, and provide organisation mentors with results to help them focus follow ups
--->

## Competencies, Behaviours and Knowledge units

* TC1 Logic: writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language 
* TC4 Test: can test code and analyse results to correct errors found using either V-model manual testing and/or using unit testing
* TC10 Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object oriented, event driven or procedural)

## Resources 

* Slides
* Laptops
* Internet access
* post-its
* pens
* flips, index cards

## Mentors / Languages
 
Two–three mentors required in addition to leads. These should be able to cover support for the required languages.

Several exercises (katas and code starters) will need to be ported to required languages.

## Prep-work for apprentices

None

## Exercises

### Day One

* Identify objects from business scenario (groups)
* Model a pack of playing cards (groups)
* Use abstraction to make the _Snap!_ game work for normal cards (groups)
* Refactor the card model using inheritance (groups)
* Use polymorphism to implement _Super Snap!_ using a mixture of card types

## Day Two

* Adapting Checkout Kata (pairs)
* Separating responsibilities from Checkout Kata (pairs)
* Receipt duplication (pairs)
* TDD Bowling Kata (pairs)

# Day One

## OO

(30 minutes)

* Programming paradigms
* Why OO?
* How to think about objects

## Source Control and Git Hub
(30 minutes)

* Why source control
* Create repo
* Clone repo
* Commit
* Push

## OO Principles

* Modelling some classic scenarios with objects (1 hour)

(Lunch)

(Retro/stand-up)

* Principles
  * bootcamp.Encapsulation (1 hour)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Rewrite some existing code to remove inappropriate intimacy and coupling
    * Code review some existing code
  * Abstraction (1 hour)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Rewrite some existing code to abstract complexity
    * Explain difference between encapsulation and abstraction
    * Introduce to interfaces
  * Polymorphism (30 minutes)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Give some examples

## Day one quiz

# Day Two

## Single Responsibility
(1 hour)

* Critique poorly implemented checkout kata
* Write their own <insert something moderately complex here>
* Single constuctor

## DRY
(1 hour)

* Definition
* Change something which has duplication to suffer the pain
* Reflect on what we observed
* Talk about why duplication is bad
* Show examples of duplication
* Discuss why duplication happens
* Rewrite the thing they looked at before to remove duplication

## Retro/stand-up

## Red Green Refactor
(1 hour)

* Why do we write tests
* Why do we write tests first
* Why people might not write tests first
* Mention levels of testing (only covering unit testing in this boot camp)
* Introduce red green refactor and discuss why
  * Short feedback loops
  * Reduced context
  * Refactoring to make code betterer
* Show them the process (find a video or create some slides or do it live)

* Implement something like bowling kata or roman numerals kata (1 hour)
* Reflect on exercise
  * What did you like
  * What was hard

* Do the checkout kata with red green refactor (1 hour)

## Retro/stand-up

## Day two quiz

# Briefing for organisation mentors

* Draw a diagram showing how the classes interact in some code you have been working on
* Find examples of:
  * Multiple responsibilities
  * duplication
  * broken encapsulation
* Do a kata using the red green refactor practice
* Spend a day doing red green refactor on your codebase with a pair, and leave some time at the end of the day to reflect / retrospect
  * Did you enjoy it
  * What made it difficult
  * What made it easier
