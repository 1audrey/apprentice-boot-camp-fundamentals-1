# Day One

## OO
(30 minutes)

* Programming paradigms
* Why OO?
* How to think about objects

## Source Control and Git Hub
(30 minutes)

* Why source control
* Create repo
* Clone repo
* Commit
* Push

## OO Principles

* Modelling some classic scenarios with objects (1 hour)

(lunch)

* Principles
  * Encapsulation (1 hour)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Rewrite some existing code to remove inappropriate intimacy and coupling
    * Code review some existing code
  * Abstraction (1 hour)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Rewrite some existing code to abstract complexity
    * Explain difference between encapsulation and abstraction
    * Introduce to interfaces
  * Polymorphism (30 minutes)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Give some examples

# Day Two

## Single Responsibility
(1 hour)

* Critique poorly implemented checkout kata
* Write their own <insert something moderately complex here>
* Single constuctor

## DRY
(1 hour)

* Definition
* Change something which has duplication to suffer the pain
* Reflect on what we observed
* Talk about why duplication is bad
* Show examples of duplication
* Discuss why duplication happens
* Rewrite the thing they looked at before to remove duplication

## Red Green Refactor
(1 hour)

* Why do we write tests
* Why do we write tests first
* Mention levels of testing (only covering unit testing in this boot camp)
* Introduce red green refactor and discuss why
  * Short feedback loops
  * Reduced context
  * Refactoring to make code betterer
* Show them the process (find a video or create some slides or do it live)

* Implement something like bowling kata or roman numerals kata (1 hour)
* Reflect on exercise
  * What did you like
  * What was hard

* Do the checkout kata with red green refactor (1 hour)

# Briefing for organisation mentors

* Draw a diagram showing how the classes interact in some code you have been working on
* Find examples of:
  * Multiple responsibilities
  * duplication
  * broken encapsulation
* Do a kata using the red green refactor practice
* Spend a day doing red green refactor on your codebase with a pair, and leave some time at the end of the day to reflect / retrospect
  * Did you enjoy it
  * What made it difficult
  * What made it easier
