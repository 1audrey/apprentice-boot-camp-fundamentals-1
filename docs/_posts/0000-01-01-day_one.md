\*[Van Roy](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf)

Note:
There are many different programming paradigms - take a moment to talk through the diagram.
From imperative languages such as C through Java and object-orientation through to functional.
Emphasise the distinction is fuzzy and that Java isn't purely functional but now has some functional features.
**Mention the "Turing Completeness" line.**

Note:
Alan Turing - who is he?
The notion of Turing Completeness and the fact that all the languages below the line on the previous slide have the same programming power.

## What are objects

* A combination of data and behaviour
* Just like in the real world

---

## A simple object-oriented modelling technique

For a given scenario:

* Nouns == Things == Objects
* Verbs == Doing Words == Methods

--

# Example

_The cat sat on the mat_

## Exercise (60mins)

Here's a simple description of an online car advertising business <a href="#/4/1">Mini AT Scenario</a>

Identify the following:

* The Objects
* Their attributes
* Their behaviours

## Exercise review (10mins)

What object oriented principles did we use in our design?

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

* Principles
  * Encapsulation (1 hour)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Rewrite some existing code to remove inappropriate intimacy and coupling
    * Code review some existing code
  * Abstraction (1 hour)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Rewrite some existing code to abstract complexity
    * Explain difference between encapsulation and abstraction
    * Introduce to interfaces
  * Polymorphism (30 minutes)
    * Apply to modelling
    * Give some examples
